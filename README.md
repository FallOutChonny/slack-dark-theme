## How to use

Its very easy to use, just download [darkify-slack.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FallOutChonny/slack-dark-theme/master/darkify-slack.sh) that in this repo, then open your terminal and type

```
sudo sh /path/to/darkify-slack.sh
```

It will automatically install the dark theme into slack for you, once install successfully, terminal will display `Dark theme applied to Slack.` message, then you just need restart your slack and enjoy it!
